# Vanilla Todo

Todos are my "hello world". And this was a project that I started at the end of 2014 to test how localStorage works.

As you can see, we're already on 2017, and I've been through 3 iterations here. The thing that is equal in all of them is: simple javascript (not really the fancy stuff).

Keep in mind that this (actually pretty much all of my repos) is a study repository. I learn new things, I come back here and start a new iteration.

## Run
Clone the repository and install it's dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Test
You need to have Grunt installed. Grunt will run the unit tests created inside specs folder

```
grunt jasmine
```

## Compatibility
Not everything is ES6 pretty, but some functions don't have IE support, so... ðŸ¤¡
